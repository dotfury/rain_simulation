# Rain Simulation
3d rain simulation in Processing

### Controls
- This simulation is controlled by mouse movement.
    - Moving the mouse up, the wind blows away from the screen.
    - Moving the mouse down, the wind blows towards the screen.
    - Moving the mouse right, the wind blows to the right.
    - Moving the mouse left, the wind blows to the left.

### Files
- `rain_simulation.pde`: Main scene file
- `Drop.pde`: Rain drop class
- `Collision.pde`: Handles collision effects when a drop touches the ground
- `Particle.pde`: Droplets when a rain drop hits the ground
- `Ring.pde`: Little rings when a rain drop hits the ground
